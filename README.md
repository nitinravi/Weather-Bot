# Weather-Bot

A Discord Weather Bot that gives the user information on weather reports in their region and suggests helpful measures.

 ## About the bot
 
 This project is a submission for "MLH Not University hacks" hackathon.
 Its sole purpose is to make it easy for the user to handle situations of severe weather. In favour to this, my bot also offers suggestions to the user based on the weather information fetched.
  
 The Discord bot is a simple weather bot that integrates AccuWeather's API Service to fetch weather information in a region.
 it is coded using the discord.py library.
